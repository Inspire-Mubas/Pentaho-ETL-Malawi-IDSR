Malawi IDSR Covid-19 Synthetic DataSet
Contents of the dataset archive:

Version 2.0 contains several datasets:
- with 100 records (Malawi_IDSR_Covid19SyntheticDataSet_v10_100.csv)
- with 1,000 records (Malawi_IDSR_Covid19SyntheticDataSet_v10_1000.csv)
- with 10,000 records (Malawi_IDSR_Covid19SyntheticDataSet_v10_10000.csv)
- with 100,000 records (Malawi_IDSR_Covid19SyntheticDataSet_v10_1ht.csv)

The main difference from v1.0 is that there is an additional field called REPR_ID representing the ID for the MOH employyee recording a case using the IDSR form. Each facility is assigned a set number of health professionals, between 3 and 10, who can record cases.  
In v1.0 each case (row) was generated by a random case recorded, hence in principle you had as many health professionals as cases which is not realistic.
